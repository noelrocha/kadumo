== DESCRIPTION:

Background tasks in Ruby On Rails made dead simple.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Running long background tasks outside of request-response cycle.
* Very easy to setup and fun to use (See examples below). 
* Clean and straightforward approach (database-based priority queue).
* Uses database table (migration included) to store jobs reliably.
* Capistrano tasks included. 
* Generators with migrations and example views (Prototype required) included (to be used with concurrency enabled).
* Multiple worker daemons available.
* Easy to deploy in distributed environments.
* Enables prioritizing and simple scheduling.
* Optional worker monitoring (good for AJAX progress bars).
* Proven its stability and reliability in production use.


== SYNOPSIS:

  ruby ./script/generate background
  rake db:migrate
  
  # to run in production mode use RAILS_ENV=production ruby ./script/daemons start
  ruby ./script/daemons start

  # then try in console:
    
  job_id = Job.enqueue!(ExampleWorker, :add, 1, 2).id

  # after few seconds when background daemon completes the job

  Job.find(job_id).result # result of the job should equal 3
  
  If you want to use default generated views, update your config/routes.rb:
  
  map.namespace "admin" do |admin|
    admin.resources :jobs
  end
  
  Then you can point your browser to http://localhost:3000/admin/jobs

== EXAMPLES:

  # In lib/workers/example_worker.rb:

  # Simple, non-monitored worker.
  class ExampleWorker
  
    def add(a, b)
      a + b
    end

  end

  # In lib/workers/example_monitored_worker.rb:

  # Remeber to include BackgroundFu::WorkerMonitoring.
  class ExampleMonitoredWorker

    include BackgroundFu::WorkerMonitoring
  
    def long_and_monitored
      my_progress = 0
    
      record_progress(my_progress)

      while(my_progress < 100)
        my_progress += 1
        record_progress(my_progress)
        sleep 1
      end
    
      record_progress(100)
    end
  
  end

  # In a controller:

    def create
      session[:job_id] = Job.enqueue!(ExampleWorker, :add, 1, 2).id
      # or try the monitored worker: session[:job_id] = Job.enqueue!(ExampleMonitoredWorker, :long_and_monitored)
    end

    def show
      @job    = Job.find(session[:job_id])
      @result = @job.result if @job.finished?
      # or check progress if your worker is monitored: @progress = @job.progress
    end
  
    def index
      @jobs = Job.find(:all)
    end
  
    def destroy
      Job.find(session[:job_id]).destroy
    end

== HANDY CAPISTRANO TASKS:

  namespace :deploy do

    desc "Run this after every successful deployment" 
    task :after_default do
      restart_background_fu
    end

  end

  desc "Restart BackgroundFu daemon"
  task :restart_background_fu do
    run "RAILS_ENV=production ruby #{current_path}/script/daemons stop"
    run "RAILS_ENV=production ruby #{current_path}/script/daemons start"
  end
  
== BONUS FEATURES:

There are bonus features available if you set
config.active_record.allow_concurrency = true
in your environment.

These features are: 
 * monitoring progress (perfect for ajax progress bars)
 * stopping a running worker in a merciful way.
 
Generated admin views are meant to be used only when bonus features (concurrency) are enabled.

Read the code (short and easy) to discover them.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* rails
* daemons

== INSTALL:

* As a Rails plugin: ./script/plugin install git://github.com/ncr/background-fu.git
* As as a gem to be 'vendorized' starting from Rails 2.1: refer to documentation on rake gems:unpack:dependencies.
